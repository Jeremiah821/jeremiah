# Working notes

- Add checks for obvious data leaks between splits.

- Track how each feature was engineered.

- Save small CSV slices for quick sanity checks.

- Prefer simple baselines before complex models.

- Keep experiment configurations under version control.

- Write down what was tried, not only what worked.

- Distinguish data issues from modeling issues.

- Revisit assumptions when metrics plateau.

- Inspect raw samples before trusting the dataset.
